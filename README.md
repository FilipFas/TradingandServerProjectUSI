# Trading and Server Project USI

This project has been developed according to the instruction given by Prof. Peter Gruber PhD, as part of the course "Programming in Finance and Economics II" at Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana.

## Project Description
The TradingProject aims to leverage a Virtual Private Server (VPS) to execute an algorithmic trading bot. The bot is designed to interact with the Crypto market, execute trades based on a predefined strategy, and store the results for analysis. Additionally, the project includes functionality to display these trading results in a user-friendly format.

## Use of Generative AI

### Overview
Generative AI tools, specifically ChatGPT-4 and GitHub Copilot, were extensively used to enhance productivity, code quality, and project documentation.

### AI Tools Utilized
- **ChatGPT-4**: Assisted with generating, refining, and debugging code, as well as drafting comprehensive documentation.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Helped write boilerplate code, suggest improvements, and automate repetitive coding tasks.

### Applications of AI in the Project
1. **Code Enhancement and Optimization**:
    - **ChatGPT-4**: Optimized the trading algorithm for better performance.
    - **GitHub Copilot**: Provided inline code suggestions and improved code readability.

2. **Problem Solving and Debugging**:
    - **ChatGPT-4**: Offered solutions to coding issues and explained complex concepts.
    - **GitHub Copilot**: Identified potential errors and suggested fixes.

3. **HTML and Web Development**:
    - **ChatGPT-4**: Created and refined HTML templates for the web interface.
    - **GitHub Copilot**: Suggested HTML and CSS code snippets for quick development.

### Impact of Generative AI
The use of Generative AI tools like ChatGPT-4 and GitHub Copilot:
- **Accelerated Development**: Reduced the time required for coding and debugging.
- **Enhanced Code Quality**: Improved the overall quality and readability of the codebase.
- **Facilitated Learning**: Enabled quick learning of new technologies.
- **Streamlined Documentation**: Ensured comprehensive and well-structured documentation.

## Installation and Usage
### VPS Server
Firstly, it's important to buy the right VPS. We suggest purchasing one with at least 2GB of RAM, 50GB of SSD, and 1 IPv4 address. Here you can find some good deals ([RackNerd](https://www.racknerd.com/BlackFriday/)). 

*Disclaimer: We're not affiliated with nor sponsored by RackNerd, and we do not receive any referral benefits for mentioning them.*

After that you need to setup your VPS to better suit the purpose of the project. [Here](Server/VPS_Setup.md) the instructions that we used.

Other informations on how we setup our SQL database on the VPS can be found [here](Server/Website/CreateSQLDatabase.md).

#### Website
We used the powefull Python package [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for most of the work on the VPS, to create the website and connect it with the VPS. [Here](/Server/Website) you can find how to replicate our steps.

To furthere proceed with the project we purchased a domain for our website from [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains) and connected it with a SSH Certificate to update the website from http to https (a more secure protocol). To do that we used the free platform [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org), that not only provide a SSH Certificate for free but also present all the necessary steps to install it in a simple way.

Complete this steps the website is only and is now accessible at the following [link](https://www.algotradingproject.online).



### Algotrading Bot
The Algotrading Bot runs using Python, before running it check if all the requirements are correctly installed ([Bot Requirements](/TradingBot/requirements.txt)). If not sure, run the following code:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To access the Binance Futures API, and so to run the bot, is important to create new API keys and update the [relative file](/TradingBot/api_keys.json) containing them. Here the [link](https://testnet.binancefuture.com/en/futures/BTCUSDT) to create the API keys (requires the creation of an account to access). This gives access to a paper trading account with 15'000 USDT. 

After that you can run the program contained in [bot.py](/TradingBot/bot.py). 

*Changes can be done but we reserve them to the curiosity of the reader. We also suggest, when making changes, to double check everything to avoid unpleasent errors.*

## Project Status
The TradingProject is currently under active development. We are continuously refining the algorithmic trading strategy and enhancing the display of trading results. 

*The VPS and the website will be running until April 2025, after that the contracts with the VPS and domain providers will expire and the results will be no more accessible from the website page.*

*Also the website will be accessible only during the following hours (from 6:00 to 18:00 CET) to avoid excessive bandwidth usage.*
